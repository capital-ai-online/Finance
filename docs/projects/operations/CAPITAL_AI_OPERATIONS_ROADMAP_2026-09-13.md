# CAPITAL-AI-OPS — Roadmap 2026-09-13

**Project:** `CAPITAL-AI-OPS`  
**Folder:** `docs/projects/operations/`  
**Owner/PVC:** `CAPITAL-AI-OPS / PVC-02, PVC-04, PVC-06, PVC-07, PVC-08, PVC-18`  
**Status:** `ACTIVE — CANONICAL DATED ROADMAP`  
**Baseline:** `main@9634053b222725db69d557f61d44d77b9eb8cb04` (PR #900 merged)  
**Superseded baseline:** `archive/CAPITAL_AI_OPERATIONS_ROADMAP_SUPERSEDED_2026-09-13.md`

## Consolidation rule
All non-terminal work from the superseded OPS roadmap remains active with unchanged IDs/constraints unless explicitly replaced below. Terminal history is not reopened. Provider/production mutation remains separately authorized.

## Active work packages

### OPS-CARRY-01 — Existing non-terminal OPS backlog
Carry forward all non-terminal OPS work, including controlled implementation, supervisor, version, release, production, EventMesh/trace, recovery, evidence and independently owned verification dependencies.

### OPS-PR900-01 — Event-driven development chain
Correlate the Option-C/project-listener work against current main and applicable authority. Define trigger payloads, deterministic state transitions, idempotency/replay, owner-correct handoff evidence and continuation events; prefer event-native triggers to polling.

**Exit:** one current listener/event flow; no duplicate active listener; every handoff records source event, owner/PVC, exit evidence and continuation trigger.

### OPS-PR900-02 — Deterministic version/release/deploy identity
Complete Stage-2 PVC-06/PVC-07 validation, reconcile version-rule and Release Version Gate semantics, and prove exact-SHA promotion plus post-deploy identity. Render native Auto Deploy remains off unless separately authorized.

**Exit:** one exact snapshot has truthful PASS/FAIL/NOT_AVAILABLE checks, deterministic version/release agreement and production identity evidence.

### OPS-PR900-03 — GitHub Enterprise capability matrix
Complete read/write capability coverage for Enterprise controls, custom properties, efficient Actions/artifact/cache usage and repository integration. Governance/Security/QM constraints remain authoritative.

**Exit:** capability matrix distinguishes available, unavailable, read-only and protected-mutation paths with evidence.

### OPS-PR900-04 — Multi-LLM gateway / OAuth2 / MCP convergence
Correlate existing gateway foundations; select/reuse one canonical architecture; retire or justify duplicates. Protected provider operations must be least-privileged, attributable and auditable; migration requires rollback/compatibility evidence.

**Exit:** no parallel gateway/control plane; OAuth/MCP/provider activation remains explicitly gated.

### OPS-PR900-05 — Production observability/readiness
Define measurable SLI/SLO, incident, release, post-deploy and telemetry evidence; integrate vendor export/readback only when authorized. PostHog/provider telemetry must respect SEC/privacy constraints.

**Exit:** readiness is evidence-derived, not estimated; no synthetic percentage or synthetic PASS.

### OPS-PR900-06 — Security owner returns
Return reproducible evidence for CORS composition, CSP reporting/strict-CSP promotion, unsupported-method denial, auth audit coverage, deployed supervisor behavior, ULS Stripe→auth.users→subscriptions lineage, recovery/RPO/RTO and demo-billing isolation where owned by OPS.

**Exit:** each return is exact-identity/time/snapshot bound and ready for independent SEC verification.

## Dependencies
GOV authority, QM gate classification, SEC/COMP verification, CLIENT request boundary, DATA/FINTECH child returns.

## Project exit gate
One active OPS roadmap; all non-terminal baseline work and PR-900 OPS packages are owner-correct; deployment/provider mutation is never inferred from repository implementation.
