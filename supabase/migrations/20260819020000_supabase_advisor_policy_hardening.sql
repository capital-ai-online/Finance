-- PR #414 follow-up: Supabase advisor hardening.
--
-- Scope:
-- 1) replace deprecated auth.role()-based service-role RLS policies with explicit TO service_role,
-- 2) add the missing covering index for seo_content_inventory.primary_keyword_id.
--
-- Intentionally NOT changed:
-- - agent_audit_events and SEO tables remain RLS-enabled with no client policies where designed
--   as server-only deny-by-default tables; adding permissive policies merely to suppress an INFO
--   advisor finding would weaken the access model.
-- - unused indexes are not removed without production workload evidence.
-- - leaked-password protection is a Supabase plan capability and is not a database migration.

begin;

-- Explicit role targeting avoids deprecated auth.role() evaluation and removes the per-row
-- auth RLS init-plan advisor warning. Grants remain the first authorization boundary.
